these are various mini-programs to test the dbi infrastructure and its
associated plugins. although they are included in the CVS tree, they will not
appear in the actual distribution (since the main configure.in and makefile.am
won't include it). to compile, first compile and install the rest of libdbi.
then, run gcc -ldl -ldbi -o FOO FOO.C.  Add -g to the gcc options if you want
to be able to debug with gdb.
