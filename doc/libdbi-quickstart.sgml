    <Para>
      libdbi uses a plugin system that allows various databases to be supported simultaneously, and can dynamically load or unload drivers that are supplied by libdbi or a third party. The library is initiallized by calling <XRef linkend="dbi-initialize"> and a connection instance is started by calling either <XRef linkend="dbi-conn-new"> or both <XRef linkend="dbi-driver-open"> and <XRef linkend="dbi-conn-open">.
    </Para>
    <Para>
      The connection's options (username, password, hostname, etc.) are set with <XRef linkend="dbi-conn-set-option"> and <XRef linkend="dbi-conn-set-option-numeric">. Once all options are set, <XRef linkend="dbi-conn-connect"> will connect to the database, waiting to handle a <XRef linkend="dbi-conn-query">. A query is a string containing a valid SQL statement. libdbi provides several functions to automatically quote any characters that might screw up the query string. The preferred functions are <xref linkend="dbi-conn-quote-string"> and <xref linkend="dbi-conn-quote-string-copy"> as they take into consideration the character encoding used by the current connection. The legacy functions <xref linkend="dbi-driver-quote-string"> and <xref linkend="dbi-driver-quote-string-copy"> are still supported but should be avoided in new code. After a successful query, you can retrieve rows with <XRef linkend="dbi-result-first-row">, <XRef linkend="dbi-result-last-row">, <XRef linkend="dbi-result-prev-row">, <XRef linkend="dbi-result-next-row">, and <XRef linkend="dbi-result-seek-row">.
    </Para>
    <para>String data may be sent to and retrieved from a database using character encodings if they contain characters not covered by the ASCII character set. Most database engines support character encodings like ISO-8859-1, suitable for many European languages, or even the multibyte Unicode character sets like UTF-8. The character set used to store your data in your database is usually set by the <command moreinfo="none">CREATE DATABASE</command> command, which you have to take care of yourself. libdbi uses the connection option "encoding" to select a particular character encoding for the current connection. If you set the value to "auto", libdbi will automatically use the database character encoding as the connection encoding. If you request a different character encoding, as defined by its <ulink url="http://www.iana.org">IANA</ulink> name, libdbi will convert the data on the fly.</para>
    <Para>
      There are two methods for fetching field data, and two ways to perform each method. You can either "pull" the data from DBI using the <Literal>dbi_result_get_*</Literal> family of functions, or have DBI automatically "push" the data into predefined variables with the <Literal>dbi_result_bind_*</Literal> family of functions.
    </Para>
    <Para>
      Pulling the data from the database can be done with one of the "get" functions such as <XRef linkend="dbi-result-get-long"> or <XRef linkend="dbi-result-get-string">, which simply return the data in the field you asked for. You can also get more than one field at a time with <XRef linkend="dbi-result-get-fields">, which uses a printf-like syntax.
    </Para>
    <Para>
      If you want DBI to automatically fill your program's variables with field values whenever a new row is fetched, you can "bind" fields to your variables. Bindings are set up with <XRef linkend="dbi-result-bind-long">, <XRef linkend="dbi-result-bind-string">, and the rest of the bind family of functions. Like the associated "get" function, you can set up multiple bindings at once with the <XRef linkend="dbi-result-bind-fields"> function.
    </Para>
    <Para><Emphasis>Caveats:</Emphasis></Para>
    <ItemizedList>
      <ListItem><Para>For fields holding integers (not fractional numbers), DBI differentiates between signed and unsigned variables. By default, DBI returns signed values. If you want an unsigned value, prepend a "u" to the name of the target type. For example, dbi_result_bind_short becomes dbi_result_bind_ushort.</Para></ListItem>
      <ListItem><Para>You must set up any bindings AFTER a successful query but BEFORE you fetch any rows. Even if you are using field bindings, you can still use the dbi_result_get_* functions as usual. (actually, I lied... setting up a binding should theoretically work at any time, but don't plan on this behavior in future versions)</Para></ListItem>
      <ListItem><Para>All string and binary data returned or bound from DBI is READ-ONLY. If you want your own local copy that can be modified at will, use <XRef linkend="dbi-result-get-string-copy">, <XRef linkend="dbi-result-get-binary-copy">, <XRef linkend="dbi-result-bind-string-copy">, or <XRef linkend="dbi-result-bind-binary-copy">. You will be responsible for freeing the memory allocated by these functions.</Para></ListItem>
    </ItemizedList>
    <Para>
      <XRef linkend="dbi-result-next-row"> and the other row-seeking functions will return zero when there are no more rows available. Before the next database operation is performed, you must call <XRef linkend="dbi-result-free">.  Before the program terminates, the connection must be disconnected and unloaded with <XRef linkend="dbi-conn-close"> and libdbi must be unloaded with <XRef linkend="dbi-shutdown">.
