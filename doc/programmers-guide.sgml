    <Abstract>
      <Para>
	libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C,
	similar to the DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code,
	programmers can leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple
	simultaneous database connections by using this framework.
      </Para>

  <Chapter id="intro"><Title>Introduction</Title>
    <Section id="description"><Title>Description</Title>
      <Para>
	libdbi provides application developers with a database independent abstraction
	layer for C. It handles the database-specific implementations for each type of
	database, so that you can use the same exact code with any type of database server
	that libdbi supports. You can initiate and use multiple database connections
	simultaneously, regardless of the types of database servers you are connecting to.
	The driver architecture allows for new database drivers to be easily added
	dynamically.
      </Para>
    </Section>
    <Section id="terminology"><Title>libdbi Concepts and Terminology</Title>
      <para>In this guide, the terms <Quote>user</Quote> and <Quote>programmer</Quote> are used interchangably, since the target audience is the software developer using libdbi in his	program. A star character (*) represents a wildcard matching any letters. For example, <Quote>dbi_conn_*</Quote> would represent all functions beginning with <Quote>dbi_conn_</Quote>.</para>
      <para>Before doing anything useful, your program must initialize libdbi. This creates an <quote>instance</quote> of libdbi which is accessible through a handle. The libdbi architecture provides several <quote>drivers</quote>, one for each type of database server. All drivers are loaded into memory by each libdbi instance upon initialization and are made available to the programmer. Once a driver is <Emphasis>instantiated</Emphasis>, it represents a distinct database session and is called a <Quote>connection</Quote>.</Para>

    <title>Building and Installing libdbi</title>
    <para>libdbi uses the "autotools", i.e. <application moreinfo="none">automake</application>, <application moreinfo="none">autoconf</application>, and <application moreinfo="none">libtool</application> to provide a simple and consistend build and install process on all supported platforms. The good news is that you usually don't have to fiddle that much with <command moreinfo="none">./configure</command> as libdbi provides only a single option:</para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><option>--disable-docs</option></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>If you build libdbi from a tarball, the docs are already prebuilt and ready to install. In this case, you don't need this option. However, if you build from a cvs checkout, this is a simple way to switch off building the documentation. This is useful if you don't want to install the prerequisites for building the docs (<application moreinfo="none">openjade</application>, the DocBook DSSSL stylesheets, <application moreinfo="none">TeX</application>, and <application moreinfo="none">JadeTeX</application>).</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>If you type <command moreinfo="none">./configure --help</command>, you'll see a few more options. These are provided by the autotools, and you should consult their documentation to make best use of them.</para>
    <para>Once you have figured out which options to use or not, you are ready to go ahead and run:</para>
    <screen format="linespecific">
      <prompt moreinfo="none">$ </prompt><command moreinfo="none">./configure [your options]</command>
      <prompt moreinfo="none">$ </prompt><command moreinfo="none">make</command>
      <prompt moreinfo="none">$ </prompt><command moreinfo="none">sudo make install</command>
