INTRODUCTION:
-------------

libdbi provides application developers with a database independent abstraction layer for C. It handles the database-specific implementations for each type of database, so that you can use the same exact code with any type of database server that libdbi supports. You can initiate and use multiple database connections simultaneously, regardless of the types of database you are connecting to. The plugin architecture allows for new database drivers to be easily added dynamically by a third party.
