libdbi - Database Independent Abstraction Layer for C
Copyright (C) 2001-2002, David Parker and Mark Tobenkin.
http://libdbi.sourceforge.net


INTRODUCTION:
-------------

libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C, similar to the
DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code, programmers can
leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple simultaneous database
connections by using this framework.

The plugin architecture allows for new database drivers to be easily added by a
third party with flexbile licensing.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

Perform the regular ./configure, make, make install. See INSTALL for the
generic details of each step. Some of the libdbi-specific options to configure
that may interest you are: --with-mysql, --with-pgsql. These will enable
compilation of specific database drivers, of which you will need at least one
to make libdbi do anything useful. See ./configure --help for more libdbi
configuration options.

If you are building the Win32 port, see README.win32.


FEATURES:
---------

 * Database-level abstraction:
   Your programs don't need to deal with the arbitrary interfaces and oddities
   of each database library. libdbi handles all the details for you, you just
   tell it what you want the database to do.
   
 * Modularity:
   Since database code written with libdbi is not tied to one specific database
   server, you can effortlessly switch databases or give your users the option
   to specify their own database settings.
   
 * Clean interface:
   With ample documentation describing libdbi and its well thought out
   object-oriented design, programming with libdbi should be less painful than
   programming with native database libraries. And you only need to learn it
   once instead of learning each database library's syntax.
   
 * Accommodates coder apathy:
   libdbi is written to do The Right Thing(tm), not just some quick hack that
   does the job in a half-assed fashion. This saves tons of your $100/hour time
   from debugging, so that you can mess around having fun during the hours that
   clients are paying you to debug.  It also strives to reduce the worldwide
   crisis of carpal tunnel syndrome, so it uses constructs such as this one to
   pack multiple function calls into one line, saving you the bother of typing
   more than you have to: 
   dbi_result_get_fields(result, "id.%i firstname.%s lastname.%s fractional_value.%f", &id, &firstname, &lastname, &floatval);
   
 * Plugin interface:
   The dynamic linking used by libdbi allows for driver authors to license
   their drivers however they please - they are not restricted to the GPL or
   LGPL. Drivers are easy to write, and require no special installation.
   
 * Error handling:
   Instead of checking every single database call for errors, libdbi gives
   programmers the option of registering an error handler callback, similar to
   a signal handler. Because we know you'll "forget" to check for errors
   otherwise :)
   
 * Convenience:
   Spend your time writing clever code, not reinventing the wheel with your own
   single-use, #define-abusing, less featureful database interface.
